= The Bart Docs
:description: The `00-` file is the "title and metadata" file. Things like the \
project/book title are here, the author line is here, as well as any document \
attributes (for example, a `:doctype: book` attribute in asciidoc), etc. 

Welcome to the `bart` documentation! Here you'll find an example project that
contains information about how to use `bart` to manage your plain-text writing
projects.
