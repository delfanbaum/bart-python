:description: While I will always recommend using asciidoc, so long as the \
relevant "build" executable is available (should this be configurable? \
Probably.), we will `glob` and combine and build whatever appropriately \
prefixed files match the file extension of the `00-` file. In other words, \
you can't mix filetypes within a project (this would be madness!), but you \
can use pretty much whatever you want.
